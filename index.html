            <p> The capital of Italy is a vibrant, energetic and stylish city. While thoroughly modern in sensibility,
                Rome is also home to some of the world’s most important works of classic art and architecture. This city
                has been an epicenter for culture, politics and religion for more than 2,500 years. From the Spanish
                Steps to the Vatican, there are more than enough sights to keep even the most active tourists busy and
                even somewhere as popular as Rome you can find places just off the tourist trail and bustling with
                locals.

                The Amalfi Coast, located in Southern Italy. Deemed an outstanding example of a Mediterranean landscape
                by
                Unesco, the Amalfi Coast is one of Italy's most memorable destinations. Here, mountains plunge into the
                sea in a nail-biting vertical scene of precipitous crags, cliff-clinging abodes and verdant woodland.
